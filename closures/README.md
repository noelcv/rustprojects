# Closures

Closures can capture values from its lexical scope - but somehow looks different than JS...

**Initial hypothesis** : in the sense that in Rust we can grab the context and reference it from elsewhere, and not only from the surrounding scope.

Explore the code annotations in `src/main.rs` to find out more about it.
