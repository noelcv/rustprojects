# Collections

To explore the code with annotations open `src/main.rs`
Check the context of these annotations from [Chapter 8 - Common Collections](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch08-00-common-collections.html) of The Book.

We're about to dive into:

- Vectors `Vec<T>`
  - a kind of array that needs to know the types in advance, so that the compiler knows how much memory will need to allocate for each element
  - Additional readings: [The Rustonomicon](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/vec/vec.html),
  - [The Vec API docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html) - **push**, **pop**, etc...
  - Their values are dropped once they go out of scope
- Strings
- HashMaps
