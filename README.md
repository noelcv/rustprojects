# rustprojects or rusty notes
A collection of personal notes on "The Book" aka The Rust Programming Language.

Each directory explores one part of The Book, and usually contains:

- a README file with a quick reference guide annotations for the reference topic;
- code snippets with comments;
- type `cargo run` to execute each program in the command line, if you want to see the output.
