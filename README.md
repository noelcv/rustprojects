# rustprojects or rusty notes
A collection of personal notes on "The Book" aka The Rust Programming Language.

Each directory explores one part of The Book, and usually contains:

- a README file with a quick reference guide annotations for the reference topic;
- code snippets with comments;
- type `cargo run` to execute each program in the command line, if you want to see the output.



## TS -> RUST

In this section, we'll make a bridge of references between the JS/TS ecosystem and Rust.


It's a WIP, so I'll keep adding more...

`Package.json` - `Cargo.toml`

`npm start` - `cargo run`

`npm build` - `cargo build`

`switch` - `match`

`Array`  - `Vec` - an array that can only store values of the same type

`Object` - `HashMap`

`Interface` - `Struct`

`Enum` - `Enum`
